	abstract = {Measurements of both the average crystal structure from Rietveld refinement of neutron powder diffraction data and the local structure from La 𝐿III−edge x-ray-absorption fine structure (XAFS) are presented for a La11⁢B6 sample as a function of temperature (∼10–320⁢K). These data are compared to XAFS results on a EuB6 sample. The single-site La and B positional distribution widths and the La-B and La-La bond length distribution widths and their temperature dependence are compared. This comparison allows an estimate of the La and B site displacements, and we find that these sublattices are only slightly correlated with each other. Moreover, while the temperature dependence of the displacement parameters of the average sites obtained from diffraction fit an Einstein model well, the temperature dependence of the La-B bond length distribution width requires at least two vibrational frequencies, corresponding to the La and B frequencies of the individual sites. XAFS data on EuB6 indicate that the situation is the same in the Eu compound. In addition, comparisons between data taken below and above the ferromagnetic transition temperature for EuB6 place stringent limits on the lattice involvement in the associated metal-insulator transition and the ensuing large magnetoresistance effect. This lack of lattice involvement in the magnetoresistance transition is in sharp contrast to the strong lattice involvement observed in the colossal magnetoresistance lanthanum manganese perovskites.},

In the insulating state, distortions of the Mn-O environment are found to be linear with calcium concentration 𝑥. These distortions are consistent with a model where individual Mn3+ sites have strong Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions while Mn4+ sites do not, although intermediate distortions are also possible. Comparisons to simulations of various possible bond length distributions show that these distortions are best modeled as a JT distortion, as opposed to charge disproportionation or other models. In the metallic state, at least ∼7⁢0\% of the distortion is removed. A similar effect is seen in the Mn-Mn bond length distribution. The La-O bond length distribution does not change significantly through the ferromagnetic transition, constraining possible changes in the Mn-O-Mn bond angle to less than 0.5°. The changes in the MnO6 distortion that occur near 𝑇𝑐 are also present (to a lesser degree) in an insulating sample with 𝑥=0.12. The functional relation between the MnO6 distortions and the magnetization is determined, and compared to transport measurements.},

	abstract = {Magnetotransport investigation of a half-Heusler antiferromagnet DyPdBi revealed hallmark features of Weyl semimetal: huge negative longitudinal magnetoresistance and planar Hall effect. Both effects have recently been linked to a chiral magnetic anomaly—axial charge pumping between Weyl nodes. Magnetoresistance (MR) of single crystals of DyPdBi is very pronounced. In magnetic field longitudinal to electrical current direction it reaches −80\% and its relative difference with respect to that measured in transverse field (expressed as anisotropic magnetoresistance) is extremely strong: −60\% at 10 K and 14 T. The planar Hall effect in DyPdBi depends on temperature and magnetic field in nonmonotonous way, which has not been previously reported. We compare magnetoresistance measured with voltage contacts on midline of the sample with that measured with contacts on its edge, and show that the role of current-jetting, an extrinsic source of anisotropic negative magnetoresistance, is marginal. We discuss that nature of the compound and sample quality exclude intrinsic sources of negative and anisotropic magnetoresistance other than weak localization and the chiral magnetic anomaly.},

	abstract = {The magnetoelectric effect in bulk matter is of growing interest both fundamentally and technologically. Since the beginning of the century, the magnetoelectric effect has been studied intensively in multiferroic materials. However, magnetoelectric phenomena in materials without any (anti-)ferroic order remain almost unexplored. Here we show the observation of a new class of bulk magnetoelectric effect, by revisiting elemental trigonal tellurium. We demonstrate that elemental tellurium, which is a nonmagnetic semiconductor, exhibits current-induced magnetization. This effect is attributed to spin splitting of the bulk band owing to the lack of inversion symmetry in trigonal tellurium. This finding highlights magnetoelectricity in bulk matter driven by moving electrons without any (anti-)ferroic order. Notably, current-induced magnetization generates a magnetic field that is not circular around but is parallel to the applied current; thus, this phenomenon opens a new area of magnetic field generation beyond Ampere’s law that may lead to industrial applications.},

Heavy-fermion semimetals are a prototype of strongly correlated systems and, given their strong spin-orbit coupling, present a natural setting to make progress. Here, we advance a Weyl–Kondo semimetal phase in a periodic Anderson model on a noncentrosymmetric lattice. The quasiparticles near the Weyl nodes develop out of the Kondo effect, as do the surface states that feature Fermi arcs. We determine the key signatures of this phase, which are realized in the heavy-fermion semimetal Ce3Bi4Pd3. Our findings provide the much-needed theoretical foundation for the experimental search of topological metals with strong correlations and open up an avenue for systematic studies of such quantum phases that naturally entangle multiple degrees of freedom.},

	abstract = {All conventional metals are known to possess a three-dimensional Fermi surface, which is the locus in reciprocal space of the long-lived electronic excitations that govern their electronic properties at low temperatures. These excitations should have well-defined momenta with components in all three dimensions. The high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) copper oxide superconductors have unusual, highly two-dimensional properties above the superconducting transition1. This, coupled with a lack of unambiguous evidence for a three-dimensional Fermi surface, has led to many new and exotic models for the underlying electronic ground state2. Here we report the observation of polar angular magnetoresistance oscillations3 in the overdoped superconductor Tl2Ba2CuO6+δ in high magnetic fields, which firmly establishes the existence of a coherent three-dimensional Fermi surface. Analysis of the oscillations reveals that at certain symmetry points, however, this surface is strictly two-dimensional. This striking form of the Fermi surface topography, long-predicted by electronic band structure calculations4, provides a natural explanation for a wide range of anisotropic properties both in the normal5,6 and superconducting states7,8,9. Our data reveal that, despite their extreme electrical anisotropy, the high-Tc materials at high doping levels can be understood within a framework of conventional three-dimensional metal physics.},

	abstract = {The ground-state phases of a quantum many-body system are characterized by an order parameter, which changes abruptly at quantum phase transitions when an external control parameter is varied. Interestingly, these concepts may be extended to excited states, for which it is possible to define equivalent excited-state quantum phase transitions. However, the experimental mapping of a phase diagram of excited quantum states has not yet been realized. Here we present the experimental determination of the excited-state phase diagram of an atomic ferromagnetic quantum gas, where, crucially, the excitation energy is one of the control parameters. The obtained phase diagram exemplifies how the extensive Hilbert state of quantum many-body systems can be structured by the measurement of well-defined order parameters.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe∕CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1−xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

The number of publications alone shows that DF calculations make up a huge success story, and many younger colleagues are surprised to learn that the widespread application of density functional methods, particularly in chemistry, began only after 1990. This is indeed unexpected, because the origins are usually traced to the papers of Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham more than a quarter of a century earlier. The DF formalism, its applications, and prospects were reviewed for this journal in 1989. About the same time, the combination of DF calculations with molecular dynamics promised to provide an efficient way to study structures and reactions in molecules and extended systems. This paper reviews the development of density-related methods back to the early years of quantum mechanics and follows the breakthrough in their application after 1990. The two examples from biochemistry and materials science are among the many current applications that were simply far beyond expectations in 1990. The reasons why—50 years after its modern formulation and after two decades of rapid expansion—some of the most cited practitioners in the field are concerned about its future are discussed.},

Some of the most interesting topological phenomena, however, require topological insulators to be placed in multiply connected, highly constrained geometries with magnets and superconductors15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, all of which thus require a large number of functional variants with materials design flexibility as well as electronic, magnetic and superconducting tunability. Given the optimum materials, topological properties open up new vistas in spintronics, quantum computing and fundamental physics. We have extended the search for topological insulators from the binary Bi-based series2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to the ternary thermoelectric Heusler compounds22, 23, 24, 25. Here we show that, although a large majority of the well-known Heuslers such as TiNiSn and LuNiBi are rather topologically trivial, the distorted LnPtSb-type (such as LnPtBi or LnPdBi, Ln=fn lanthanides) compounds belonging to the half-Heusler subclass harbour Z2=−1 topological insulator parent states, where Z2 is the band purity product index. Our results suggest that half-Heuslers provide a new platform for deriving a host of topologically exotic compounds and their nanoscale or thin-film device versions through the inherent flexibility of their lattice parameter, spin–orbit strength and magnetic moment tunability paving the way for the realization of multifunctional topological devices.

As an application, we fit the measured specific heat of the compounds CeCu2Ge2, CePd3Si0.3, CePdAl, CePt, Yb2Pd2Sn and YbCo2Zn20. The agreement between theory and experiment is very good or excellent depending on the compound, except at very low temperatures due to the presence of magnetic correlations (not accounted for in the model).},

	abstract = {Heavy-fermion systems share some of the strange metal phenomenology seen in other unconventional superconductors, providing a unique opportunity to set strange metals in a broader context. Central to understanding heavy-fermion systems is the interplay of localization and itinerancy. These materials acquire high electronic masses and a concomitant Fermi volume increase as the f electrons delocalize at low temperatures. However, despite the wide-spread acceptance of this view, a direct microscopic verification has been lacking. Here we report high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements on CeCoIn5, a prototypical heavy-fermion compound, which spectroscopically resolve the development of band hybridization and the Fermi surface expansion over a wide temperature region. Unexpectedly, the localized-to-itinerant transition occurs at surprisingly high temperatures, yet f electrons are still largely localized even at the lowest temperature. These findings point to an unanticipated role played by crystal-field excitations in the strange metal behavior of CeCoIn5. Our results offer a comprehensive experimental picture of the heavy-fermion formation, setting the stage for understanding the emergent properties, including unconventional superconductivity, in this and related materials.},

	abstract = {The heavy fermion systems present a unique platform in which strong electronic correlations give rise to a host of novel, and often competing, electronic and magnetic ground states. Amongst a number of potential experimental tools at our disposal, measurements of the Hall effect have emerged as a particularly important one in discerning the nature and evolution of the Fermi surfaces of these enigmatic metals. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of Hall effect measurements in the heavy fermion materials, and examine the success it has had in contributing to our current understanding of strongly correlated matter. Particular emphasis is placed on its utility in the investigation of quantum critical phenomena which are thought to drive many of the exotic electronic ground states in these systems. This is achieved by the description of measurements of the Hall effect across the putative zero-temperature instability in the archetypal heavy fermion metal YbRh2Si2. Using the CeMIn5 (with M=Co, Ir) family of systems as a paradigm, the influence of (antiferro-)magnetic fluctuations on the Hall effect is also illustrated. This is compared to prior Hall effect measurements in the cuprates and other strongly correlated systems to emphasize on the generality of the unusual magnetotransport in materials with non-Fermi liquid behavior.},

This review presents a set of 'historical' works which established the ground bases of the thematic during the last decades. An exhaustive and systematic approach is privileged. After a general presentation in Chapter 2, the properties of heavy-fermion paramagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferromagnets are considered in Chapters 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Chapters 6 and 7 are dedicated to two specific compounds, URu\$\_2\$Si\$\_2\$ for which a 'hidden-order' phase constitutes a more-than-thirty-years-old unsolved mystery, and UTe\$\_2\$, where multiple superconducting phases have been discovered in the last two years. Experiments performed using a panel of techniques ranging from microscopic (neutron scattering, NMR, etc.) to thermodynamic (specific heat, magnetization, etc.) and transport (electrical resistivity, etc.) probes, under extreme conditions of low temperatures, intense magnetic fields and high pressures, are reviewed. They show that magnetism plays a central role in the quantum critical properties of heavy-fermion systems. An emphasis is given to the intersite magnetic fluctuations, presented as the driving force for a heavy Fermi liquid, precursor of quantum magnetic criticality ending in magnetically-ordered phases. They are also suspected to drive an unconventional mechanism for superconductivity, which develops in the vicinity of quantum magnetic phase transitions induced under pressure or magnetic field. The appearance of magnetic fluctuations and ultimately magnetic order in heavy-fermion compounds occurs in a nearly-integer-valence regime, in which \$f\$ electrons have a dual itinerant-localized character. Fermi-surface and valence studies, which give complementary information about this duality, are also considered.},

	abstract = {Thirty years of Mössbauer spectroscopy correspond roughly to twenty-five years of FeNi-invar research using this method. The first systematic study of hyperfine fields in FeNi alloys, in both bcc and fcc phases, appeared in 1963, the first spectra were published probably in 1964. A very important fact is that fcc iron is an antiferromagnet; however, this iron phase is unstable at low temperature. In 1963, the possibility of performing low-temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy experiments on fcc iron precipitates in copper was shown. We shall demonstrate that the low temperature57Fe Mössbauer spectra reveal a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic structure in FeNi-invar alloys. This structure corresponds to magnetic invar anomalies. From the viewpoint of basic research in magnetism, it was opportune to enhance these anomalies. One possible way to do this was the alloying of manganese into the invar matrix. In this contribution, we limited our examples to the study of the classical Fe0.65Ni0.35 and the new (Fe0.65Ni0.35)1−x.Mnxalloys, and refer to the literature with respect to other transition metal systems with similar properties. We will show the goal of Mössbauer spectrometry investigating the spin structure in disordered alloy systems via the vector nature of the hyperfine fields. Additionally, the combination of Mössbauer spectrometry with global techniques, i.e. DC magnetization and AC susceptibility allowed us to study the changes in magnetic properties of our disordered 3d transition metal alloys from a nearly collinear ferromagnet (pure FeNi-invar) over the reentrant spin-glasses and “pure” concentrated spinglasses towards the antiferromagnetic behaviour by varying the manganese concentration in small steps.},

Both components of the peak exist for μ0H≲1.4T, which is well past the AFM phase boundary determined from our new resistivity data. Using neutron-diffraction data taken at T=0.13(2)K for H∥[001] or [110], we show that domains of short-range AFM order change size throughout the previously determined AFM and non-Fermi liquid regions of the phase diagram, and that the appearance of a magnetic diffraction peak at (12,12,12) at μ0H≈0.4T signals canting of the ordered magnetic moment away from [111].

Observations of Yb171 NMR in elemental Yb metal and in the intermetallic compound YbAl2 at temperatures of 1.8, 4.2, and 20.4°K yield values of the Knight shift of (0.0±0.1)\%, and (7.76±0.05)\%, respectively. The absence of any detectable temperature dependence of the field for resonance indicates that the low-temperature increase in the magnetic susceptibilities of these metals is caused by isolated, localized magnetic impurities. In YbAl2, a constant susceptibility of 7.6×10−4 emu/mole remains at higher temperatures. The electronic contribution to the specific heat is found to be γ≅4×10−3 cal/mole °K2. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time T1≅0.12T sec at T=1.8°K. From these latter two measurements, in conjunction with the large positive Knight shift, we conclude that the larger part of the high-temperature χ does not arise from spin paramagnetism of the band electrons, but is orbital in origin.},

	abstract = {The co-operative Jahn-Teller effect is a phase transition which is driven by the interaction between localized orbital electronic states and the crystal lattice. The possible origins, symmetries and properties of the electron-lattice interactions and how they lead to possible hamiltonians for the coupled system are discussed. The relation of these interactions with quadrupolar interactions and magnetostriction is included. The methods of solution of the hamiltonians lead to an understanding of the electronic states, the phonon spectrum and the mixed normal modes. The wide variety of experimental techniques used on this problem are reviewed in detail and the results are compared with theoretical expressions whenever possible. The application of external stress and magnetic field is of particular significance in the case of the rare earth compounds, because they can product effects which are larger than the low-temperature spontaneous effects.},

However, no transport measurements associated with the topological surface states have been observed in these half-Heusler candidates due to the dominating contribution from bulk electrical conductance. Here we show that, by reducing the mobility of bulk carriers, a two-dimensional (2D) weak antilocalization (WAL) effect, one of the hallmarks of topological surface states, was experimentally revealed from the tilted magnetic field dependence of magnetoconductance in a topologically nontrivial semimetal LuPdBi. Besides the observation of a 2D WAL effect, a superconducting transition was revealed at Tc {\textasciitilde} 1.7 K in the same bulk LuPdBi. Quantitative analysis within the framework of a generalized BCS theory leads to the conclusion that the noncentrosymmetric superconductivity of LuPdBi is fully gapped with a possibly unconventional pairing character. The co-existence of superconductivity and the transport signature of topological surface states in the same bulk alloy suggests that LuPdBi represents a very promising candidate as a topological superconductor.},

The specific heat shows anomalies corresponding to antiferromagnetic ordering transition and crystalline field effect, but not to superconducting transition. Single-crystal neutron diffraction indicates that the antiferromagnetic structure is characterized by the propagation vector. Temperature variation of the electrical resistivity reveals two parallel conducting channels of semiconducting and metallic character. In weak magnetic fields, the magnetoresistance exhibits weak antilocalization effect, while in strong fields and temperatures below 50 K it is large and negative. At temperatures below 7 K Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations with two frequencies appear in the resistivity.

We thoroughly investigated the magnetotransport properties of high-quality single crystals of two half-Heusler phases, TbPtBi and HoPtBi, in pursuit of the characteristic features of topologically non-trivial electronic states. Both studied compounds are characterized by the giant values of transverse magnetoresistance with no sign of saturation in a magnetic field up to 14 T. HoPtBi demonstrates the Shubnikov–de Haas effect with two principal frequencies, indicating a complex Fermi surface; the extracted values of carrier effective masses are rather small, 0.18 me and 0.27 me. The investigated compounds exhibit negative longitudinal magnetoresistance and anomalous Hall effect, which likely arise from a nonzero Berry curvature.

The physical details describing the many-electron problem of magnetism are presented in this book on the basis of the density-functional approximation. The emphasis is on realistic magnets, for which the equations describing properties of the many-electron problem can only be solved by using computers. The great recent and continuing improvements are, to a very large extent, responsible for the progress in this field. Along with an introduction to the density-functional theory, the book describes representative computational methods and detailed formulas for physical properties of magnets, which include among other things the computation of magnetic ordering temperatures, the giant magnetoresistance, magneto-optical effects, weak ferromagnetism, the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, and novel quasiparticles, such as Weyl fermions and magnetic skyrmions.},

	abstract = {Large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) due to the Berry curvature in magnetic topological semimetals is attracting enormous interest due to its fundamental importance and technological relevance. Mechanisms resulting in large intrinsic AHE include diverging Berry curvature in Weyl semimetals, anticrossing nodal rings or points of non-trivial bands, and noncollinear spin structures. Here we show that a half-topological semimetal (HTS) state near a topological critical point can provide a new mechanism for driving an exceptionally large AHE. We reveal this through a systematic experimental and theoretical study of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) half-Heusler compound TbPdBi. We not only observed an unusual AHE with a surprisingly large anomalous Hall angle \{{\textbackslash}Theta\}H (tan \{{\textbackslash}Theta\}H {\textasciitilde} 2, the largest among the antiferromagnets) in its field-driven ferromagnetic (FM) phase, but also found a distinct Hall resistivity peak in the canted AFM phase within a low field range, where its isothermal magnetization is nearly linearly dependent on the field. Moreover, we observed a nearly isotropic, giant negative magnetoresistance with a magnitude of {\textasciitilde}98\%. Our in-depth theoretical modelling demonstrates that these exotic transport properties originate from the HTS state. A minimal Berry curvature cancellation between the trivial spin-up and nontrivial spin-down bands results not only in an extremely large AHE, but it also enhances the spin polarization of the spin-down bands substantially and thus leads to a giant negative magnetoresistance. Our study advances the understanding of the interplay between band topology and magnetism and offers new clues for materials design for spintronics and other applications.},

Their electrical behavior is governed by the formation of narrow gaps in the electronic band structures near EF. Both electrons and holes contribute to the conductivity, yet the dominant role is played by p-type carriers. The Hall response is strongly dependent on temperature and applied magnetic field, thus reflecting complex character of the underlying electronic structures. The Seebeck coefficient in ErPdSb is of the order of 150μV/K at room temperature making this material promising candidate for thermoelectric applications. Common to all four compounds studied is a rapid drop in the resistivity below 6–8K that seems manifest a phase transition of magnetic or superconducting origin, despite the lack of any corresponding anomalies in the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility and specific heat.},

CePdBi crystallizes in MgAgAs structure and exhibits a transition to a magnetically ordered state at TM ≃ 2 K, and a subsequent transition to a superconducting state at TC ≃ 1.3 K. The superconducting phase has a significant critical field of about 1.4 T. The x-ray diffraction, resistivity and magnetic susceptibility data show that CePdBi exhibits significant atomic disorder, which is a typical feature of Heusler alloys. It seems that the superconducting transition is caused by part of the disordered phase, which from the Meissner shielding can be estimated to constitute ∼8\% of the sample volume. Due to atomic disorder, CePdBi exhibits metamagnetic behavior below TM and spin-glass-like features just above TM. Band structure calculations confirm the magnetic ground state of the CePdBi system and the possibility of formation of a narrow pseudogap near the Fermi level, which can also be seen in resistivity data. The spin–orbit interaction strongly influences the band structure and the shape of the semiconducting gap.},

However, in parallel electric and magnetic fields (E{\textbar}{\textbar}B), charge is predicted to flow between the Weyl nodes, leading to negative magnetoresistance. This “axial” current is the chiral (Adler-Bell-Jackiw) anomaly investigated in quantum field theory. We report the observation of a large, negative longitudinal magnetoresistance in the Dirac semimetal Na3Bi. The negative magnetoresistance is acutely sensitive to deviations of the direction of B from E and is incompatible with conventional transport. By rotating E (as well as B), we show that it is consistent with the prediction of the chiral anomaly.},

Many half-Heusler compounds, RPtBi (R= rare earth) have been theoretically predicted to be topological semimetals. Among various topological attributes envisaged in RPtBi, topological surface states, chiral anomaly and planar Hall effect have been observed experimentally. Here, we report on an unusual intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the antiferromagnetic Heusler Weyl semimetal compounds GdPtBi and NdPtBi that is observed over a wide temperature range. In particular, GdPtBi exhibits an anomalous Hall conductivity of up to 60 -1cm-1 and an anomalous Hall angle as large as 23\%. Muon spin resonance (SR) studies of GdPtBi indicate a sharp antiferromagnetic transition (TN) at 9 K without any noticeable magnetic correlations above TN. Our studies indicate that Weyl points in these half-Heuslers are induced by a magnetic field via exchange-splitting of the electronic bands at or near to the Fermi energy which is the source of the chiral anomaly and the AHE.},

	abstract = {Recent theoretical studies of topologically nontrivial electronic states in Kondo insulators have pointed to the importance of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for stabilizing these states. However, systematic experimental studies that tune the SOC parameter λSOC in Kondo insulators remain elusive. The main reason is that variations of (chemical) pressure or doping strongly influence the Kondo coupling JK and the chemical potential μ—both essential parameters determining the ground state of the material—and thus possible λSOC tuning effects have remained unnoticed. Here, we present the successful growth of the substitution series Ce3Bi4(Pt1−xPdx)3 (0≤x≤1) of the archetypal (noncentrosymmetric) Kondo insulator Ce3Bi4Pt3. The Pt-Pd substitution is isostructural, isoelectronic, and isosize, and it therefore is likely to leave JK and μ essentially unchanged. By contrast, the large mass difference between the 5d element Pt and the 4d element Pd leads to a large difference in λSOC, which thus is the dominating tuning parameter in the series. Surprisingly, with increasing x (decreasing λSOC), we observe a Kondo insulator to semimetal transition, demonstrating an unprecedented drastic influence of the SOC. The fully substituted end compound Ce3Bi4Pd3 shows thermodynamic signatures of a recently predicted Weyl-Kondo semimetal.},

Tuning their elemental components, composition, and symmetry allows for the stabilization of a wide range of magnetic structures and magnetic crystalline anisotropies.

A much smaller temperature dependence of quadrupole coupling is present at ambient pressure. Both these effects give strong evidence for a valence transition towards the 4f13 (Yb3+) configuration under applied pressure. At 4.2 K this transition is completed near ∼50 kbar. No magnetic order could be detected down to 1.6 K over the whole pressure range.

	abstract = {The resistance of two-dimensional electron systems such as thin disordered films shows deviations from Boltzmann theory, which are caused by quantum corrections and are called “weak localization”. Theoretically weak localization is originated by the Langer—Neal graph in the Kubo formalism. In this review article the physics of weak localization is discussed. It represents an interference experiment with conduction electrons split into pairs of waves interfering in the back-scattering direction. The intensity of the interference (integrated over the time) can be easily measured by the resistance of the film. A magnetic field introduces a magnetic phase shift in the electronic wave function and suppresses the interference after a “flight” time proportional to 1/H. Therefore the application of a magnetic field allows a time-of-flight experiment with conduction electrons. Spin-orbit scattering rotates the spin of the electrons and yields an observable destructive interference. Magnetic impurities destroy the coherence of the phase. The experimental results as well as the theory is reviewed. The role of the spin-orbit scattering and the magnetic scattering are discussed. The measurements give selected information about the inelastic lifetime of the conduction electrons in disordered metals and raise new questions in solid state physics. Future applications of the method of weak localization are considered and expected.},

	abstract = {The two types of magnetic order that appear in metals have very different origins: 'itinerant-electron' magnetism occurs where a spin-density wave instability in a sea of itinerant electrons causes magnetic order, and 'local-moment' magnetism occurs where magnetic order comes from an instability in a liquid of local atomic magnetic moments. A class of strongly correlated electron materials exist, the heavy-electron intermetallic compounds such as alloys containing Ce or Yb, that bridges these two extremes, with itinerant-electron magnetism reigning at low temperature and local-moment magnetism at high temperature. It has been a long-standing goal to quantitatively describe the transition between the two and to discover what determines its temperature scale. Yang et al. now report a simple semiquantitative solution to the latter problem that provides a new framework for interpreting the physics of heavy electron materials. This offers the prospect to quantitatively determine the physical origin of some of the remarkable properties, such as their superconducting behaviour.},

Here TK becomes temperature dependent below ≃ 10 K, and the canonical relationship between R(H) and M(H) does not hold. ii) Superconductivity in UPt3 occurs at the borderline to magnetism: spin-density wave-like instabilities are induced by a few percent of Th or Au, whereas mass enhancement and susceptibility are rapidly reduced by Ir substitution. This suggests that spin fluctuations, rather than phonons, are important in mediating superconducting pairing of heavy fermions in UPt3. iii) The possibilities of noncubic strain induced by anisotropic superconductivity in UBe13 is investigated by ultrasound experiments. The suggestion of tetragonal strain in (U, Th)Be13 is found to be not applicable, and observed frequency and amplitude dependent absorption anomalies at T ⪡ Tc might reflect domain wall motion.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09318},
	abstract = {Magnetoresistance (MR), the change of a material's electrical resistance in response to an applied magnetic field, is a technologically important property that has been the topic of intense study for more than a quarter century. Here we report the observation of an unusual "butterfly" shaped titanic angular magnetoresistance (AMR) in the non-magnetic, Dirac material, ZrSiS. The MR is large and positive, reaching nearly 1.8 x 10{\textasciicircum}5 percent at 9 T and 2 K at an angle of 45o between the applied current (along the a-axis) and the applied field (90o is H parallel to the c-axis). Approaching 90o, a "dip" is seen in the AMR which can be traced to an angle dependent deviation from the H{\textasciicircum}2 law. By analyzing the SdH oscillations at different angles, we find that ZrSiS has a combination of 2D and 3D Dirac pockets comprising its Fermi surface and that the anomalous transport behavior coincides with a topological phase transition whose robust signature is evident despite transport contributions from other parts of the Fermi surface. We also find that as a function of angle, the temperature dependent resistivity in high field displays a broad peak-like behavior, unlike any known Dirac/Weyl material. The combination of very high mobility carriers and multiple Fermi surfaces in ZrSiS allow for large bulk property changes to occur as a function of angle between applied fields makes it a promising platform to study the physics stemming from the coexistence of 2D and 3D Dirac electrons.},

	abstract = {The recently discovered material PtSn4 is known to exhibit extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR) that also manifests Dirac arc nodes on the surface. PdSn4 is isostructural to PtSn4 with the same electron count. We report on the physical properties of high-quality single crystals of PdSn4 including specific heat, temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent resistivity and magnetization, and electronic band-structure properties obtained from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We observe that PdSn4 has physical properties that are qualitatively similar to those of PtSn4, but find also pronounced differences. Importantly, the Dirac arc node surface state of PtSn4 is gapped out for PdSn4. By comparing these similar compounds, we address the origin of the extremely large magnetoresistance in PdSn4 and PtSn4; based on detailed analysis of the magnetoresistivity ρ(H,T), we conclude that neither the carrier compensation nor the Dirac arc node surface state are the primary reason for the extremely large magnetoresistance. On the other hand, we find that, surprisingly, Kohler's rule scaling of the magnetoresistance, which describes a selfsimilarity of the field-induced orbital electronic motion across different length scales and is derived for a simple electronic response of metals to an applied magnetic field is obeyed over the full range of temperatures and field strengths that we explore.},

	abstract = {Lifshitz transition represents a sudden reconstruction of Fermi surface structure, giving rise to anomalies in electronic properties of materials. Such a transition does not necessarily rely on symmetry-breaking and thus is topological. It holds a key to understand the origin of many exotic quantum phenomena, for example, the mechanism of extremely large magnetoresistance (MR) in topological Dirac/Weyl semimetals. Here, we report studies of the angle-dependent MR (ADMR) and the thermoelectric effect in W2As3 single crystal. The compound shows a large unsaturated MR (of about 7000\% at 4.2 K and 53 T). The most striking finding is that the ADMR significantly deforms from the horizontal dumbbell-like shape above 40 K to the vertical lotus-like pattern below 30 K. The window of 30–40 K also corresponds substantial changes in Hall effect, thermopower and Nernst coefficient, implying an abrupt change of Fermi surface topology. Such a temperature-induced Lifshitz transition results in a compensation of electron-hole transport and the large MR as well. We thus suggest that the similar method can be applicable in detecting a Fermi-surface change of a variety of quantum states when a direct Fermi-surface measurement is not possible.},

We find that the angular dependent effect due to in-plane rotation follows the symmetry imposed by the lattice whereas for inter-plane rotation the degree of warping dictates the dominant features observed in simulations.

Here, using Hall-transport and magnetic-imaging in a technologically viable multilayer film, we show that topological-Hall resistivity scales with the isolated-skyrmion density over a wide range of temperature and magnetic-field, confirming the impact of the skyrmion Berry-phase on electronic transport. While we establish qualitative agreement between the topological-Hall resistivity and the topological-charge density, our quantitative analysis shows much larger topological-Hall resistivity than the prevailing theory predicts for the observed skyrmion density. Our results are fundamental for the skyrmion-THE in multilayers, where interfacial interactions, multiband transport and non-adiabatic effects play an important role, and for skyrmion applications relying on THE.},

	abstract = {Heusler compounds, initially discovered by Fritz Heusler more than a century ago, have grown into a family of more than 1,000 compounds, synthesized from combinations of more than 40 elements. Recently, by incorporating heavy elements that can give rise to strong spin–orbit coupling, non-trivial topological phases of matter, such as topological insulators, have been discovered in Heusler materials. Moreover, interplay between the symmetry, spin–orbit coupling and magnetic structure allows for the realization of a wide variety of topological phases through Berry curvature design. The topological properties of Heusler compounds can be manipulated by various external perturbations, resulting in exotic properties, such as the chiral anomaly and large anomalous, spin and topological Hall effects. In addition, the non-zero Berry curvature that arises as a result of non-collinear order gives rise to a non-zero anomalous Hall effect. Besides this k-space Berry curvature, Heusler compounds with non-collinear magnetic structures also possess real-space topological states in the form of magnetic antiskyrmions, which have not yet been observed in other materials. In this Review, we discuss Heusler compounds from a topological perspective and the connection between the topology and the symmetry properties, spin gapless semiconductors, magnetic compensated ferrimagnets, non-collinear order in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Heusler compounds, the anomalous Hall effect and, finally, magnetic antiskyrmions. Together with the new topological viewpoint and the high tunability, novel physical properties and phenomena await discovery in Heusler compounds.},

Here, we report the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) and THE in the bulk Ni2MnGa magnetic shape memory alloy. The magnetization measurement reveals the premartensite, martensite and magnetic phase transitions. A detailed analysis of AHC reveals that the intrinsic Berry phase mechanism dominates over skew scattering and side jump in all the structural phases of Ni2MnGa. Further, an additional contribution in the Hall resistivity is observed as THE. The magnitude of the THE and its temperature independent behavior indicates that the THE arises due to the real space Berry curvature induced by topologically protected magnetic skyrmion textures in the martensite and premartensite phases of Ni2MnGa. The larger magnetic field is required to vanish the topological Hall resistivity in the martensite phase in comparison to the premartensite phase, which manifests the more stable skyrmion textures in the martensite phase. The present findings open a new direction in the field of functional materials, which hosts skyrmion, exhibits anomalous transport and magnetic shape memory effect.},

The Hall conductivity is obtained as a function of temperature T , inelastic scattering rate γ, chemical potential µ, and impurity concentration x imp . We find that the new scaling law holds over a wide range of these parameters; -σ x y =(ασ x x 0 -1 + βσ x x 0 -2 )σ x x 2 + b , with σ µν (σ µν0 ) being the conductivity tensor (with only elastic scattering), which corresponds to the recent experimental observation [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103 (2009) 087206]. The condition of this scaling is examined. Also, it is found that the intrinsic mechanism depends on temperature under a resonance condition.},

In stark contrast to the existing literature, the intrinsic contribution in Ni is found to be strongly temperature dependent between 5 and 150 K, where the corresponding magnetization remains almost unchanged. This pronounced temperature dependence, a cause of the long-standing confusion concerning the physical origin of the AHE in Ni, is likely due to the existence of small band gaps caused by the spin-orbit coupling at the Fermi level. Our result helps pave the way for the general claim of the Berry-phase interpretation for the AHE, and also points out another mechanism for the temperature dependence of the AHE.},

We take into account the skew scattering through the spin-orbit coupling of the f-orbitals. Following the Fermi liquid theory, we derive the general expression for the anomalous Hall coefficient in the coherent regime. The expression shows that the anomalous Hall coefficient, which is added to the ordinary Hall coefficient, is proportional to the product of the susceptibility and the square of the resistivity at low temperatures. This behavior is confirmed to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The extension of this theory to the cuprate high temperature superconductor is also discussed shortly.},

	abstract = {The Hall effect as it is commonly encountered describes the voltage difference that builds up across a conductor when an electric current flows in the presence of a magnetic field. For ferromagnetic materials, with built-in magnetism, a similar phenomenon — known as the anomalous Hall effect — is sometimes observed even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Such an effect would not normally be expected for antiferromagnets, which have no net magnetization in the zero-field state. Inspired by recent theoretical ideas concerning the detailed origins of the anomalous Hall effect, Satoru Nakatsuji et al. show that such a counterintuitive effect can be seen in the antiferromagnetic material Mn3Sn as a consequence of the unusual and complex arrangement of its constituent magnetic moments. The effect is not only large (comparable to that of ferromagnetic metals) but easily switchable with a small applied field — a combination of properties that might prove useful for spintronic applications.},

Among all the physical phenomena that are enabled by Weyl semimetals, the chiral anomaly is the most unusual one. Here, we report signatures of the chiral anomaly in the magneto-transport measurements on the first Weyl semimetal TaAs. We show negative magnetoresistance under parallel electric and magnetic fields, that is, unlike most metals whose resistivity increases under an external magnetic field, we observe that our high mobility TaAs samples become more conductive as a magnetic field is applied along the direction of the current for certain ranges of the field strength. We present systematically detailed data and careful analyses, which allow us to exclude other possible origins of the observed negative magnetoresistance. Our transport data, corroborated by photoemission measurements, first-principles calculations and theoretical analyses, collectively demonstrate signatures of the Weyl fermion chiral anomaly in the magneto-transport of TaAs.},

Recently, by incorporating heavy elements that can give rise to strong spin–orbit coupling, non-trivial topological phases of matter, such as topological insulators, have been discovered in Heusler materials. Moreover, interplay between the symmetry, spin–orbit coupling and magnetic structure allows for the realization of a wide variety of topological phases through Berry curvature design. The topological properties of Heusler compounds can be manipulated by various external perturbations, resulting in exotic properties, such as the chiral anomaly and large anomalous, spin and topological Hall effects. In addition, the non-zero Berry curvature that arises as a result of non-collinear order gives rise to a non-zero anomalous Hall effect. Besides this k-space Berry curvature, Heusler compounds with non-collinear magnetic structures also possess real-space topological states in the form of magnetic antiskyrmions, which have not yet been observed in other materials. In this Review, we discuss Heusler compounds from a topological perspective and the connection between the topology and the symmetry properties, spin gapless semiconductors, magnetic compensated ferrimagnets, non-collinear order in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Heusler compounds, the anomalous Hall effect and, finally, magnetic antiskyrmions. Together with the new topological viewpoint and the high tunability, novel physical properties and phenomena await discovery in Heusler compounds.},

The Fermi surface of a topological metal consists of disconnected sheets, each enclosing a Weyl node, which is a point of contact between two nondegenerate bands. Such a point contact acts as a source of Berry curvature or a magnetic monopole in momentum space. Its charge, or the flux of the Berry curvature through the enclosing Fermi surface sheet, is a topological invariant. We review the current state of this rapidly growing field with a focus on bulk transport phenomena in topological metals.},

Na3Bi and Cd3As2 were predicted to be Dirac semimetals, and recently confirmed to be so by photoemission experiments. Several novel transport properties in a magnetic field have been proposed for Dirac semimetals. Here, we report a property of Cd3As2 that was unpredicted, namely a remarkable protection mechanism that strongly suppresses backscattering in zero magnetic field. In single crystals, the protection results in ultrahigh mobility, 9 × 10(6) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at 5 K. Suppression of backscattering results in a transport lifetime 10(4) times longer than the quantum lifetime. The lifting of this protection by the applied magnetic field leads to a very large magnetoresistance. We discuss how this may relate to changes to the Fermi surface induced by the applied magnetic field.},

Antiferromagnetism with ordering vector (0.5,0.5,0.5) occurs below a Ne{\textbackslash}'eel temperature that scales with de Gennes factor \$dG\$, while a superconducting transition is simultaneously linearly suppressed. With superconductivity appearing in a system with non-centrosymmetric crystallographic symmetry, the possibility of spin-triplet Cooper pairing with non-trivial topology analogous to that predicted for the normal state electronic structure provides a unique and rich opportunity to realize both predicted and new exotic excitations in topological materials.},

These properties have become of particular interest since the recent discovery of topological Weyl semimetal state for which the electronic bands are dispersed linearly around one pair of Weyl nodes, with opposite chirality (i.e., chiral anomaly). Here, we report the transport signatures of topological electronic state in a half-Heusler GdPtBi single crystal. We show that the non-trivial π Berry phase, negative magnetoresistance and giant planner Hall effect arise from the chiral anomaly and that the Shubnikov–de Haas oscillation frequency in GdPtBi is angle-dependent with an anisotropic Fermi surface (FS). All transport signatures not only demonstrate the topological electronic state in half-Heusler GdPtBi crystals, but also describe the shape of the anisotropy FS.},

However, previous studies of Weyl physics have been limited exclusively to semimetals. Here, via systematic magnetotransport measurements, two representative topological transport signatures of Weyl physics, the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance and the planar Hall effect, are observed in the elemental semiconductor tellurium. More strikingly, logarithmically periodic oscillations in both the magnetoresistance and Hall data are revealed beyond the quantum limit and found to share similar characteristics with those observed in ZrTe5 and HfTe5. The log-periodic oscillations originate from the formation of two-body quasi-bound states formed between Weyl fermions and opposite charge centers, the energies of which constitute a geometric series that matches the general feature of discrete scale invariance (DSI). Our discovery reveals the topological nature of tellurium and further confirms the universality of DSI in topological materials. Moreover, introduction of Weyl physics into semiconductors to develop “Weyl semiconductors” provides an ideal platform for manipulating fundamental Weyl fermionic behaviors and for designing future topological devices.},

Recently, the Kondo effect in Weyl semimetal was theoretically proposed but not yet experimentally realized. Here we suggest a coexistence of the Weyl semimetal and Kondo effect in disordered Mn-doped MnxVAl3. Dilute Mn-doping in type-II Dirac semimetal VAl3 increases the chemical potential so that Dirac point is close to the Fermi energy and lifts band degeneracy, leading to the Weyl semimetal phase transition. We observed a Kondo effect, confirmed by the resistivity minimum at TK = 40 K, and logarithmic increase of electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat divided by temperature with a significant Sommerfeld coefficient at low temperature. The angle-resolved magnetoresistance has revealed the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance below Kondo temperature due to chiral anomaly in Mn-doped MnxVAl3. At low temperature below Kondo temperature (T ≤ TK), the exchange interaction by RKKY interaction in MnxVAl3 breaks time-reversal symmetry even in Kondo screening, resulting in the topological phase transition from Dirac to Weyl semimetal. This research shows the coexistence of the Kondo effect and Weyl semimetallic state as well as the temperature-induced topological phase transition.},

The observations are incompatible with any previously reported magneto-transport measurements. Surprisingly, on the one hand the system exhibits signatures of chiral anomaly such as negative magnetoresistance and planar Hall effect, on the other hand, a number of features are even qualitatively beyond the existing theories. It is found that all the unusual features in transport are controlled by the quantum effects originating from strong spin-orbit coupling induced spin-momentum locking, and the traditional Lorentz mechanism plays a minimal role. The results not only open up a new avenue related to magneto-transport in spin-orbit coupled metals but also pave a path to engineer non-magnetic materials as sensors for vector magnetic fields.},

	abstract = {Weyl semimetal is a unique topological phase with topologically protected band crossings in the bulk and robust surface states called Fermi arcs. Weyl nodes always appear in pairs with opposite chiralities, and they need to have either time-reversal or inversion symmetry broken. When the time-reversal symmetry is broken the minimum number of Weyl points (WPs) is two. If these WPs are located at the Fermi level, they form an ideal Weyl semimetal (WSM). In this study, intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) EuCd2As2 are grown, predicted to be an ideal WSM and studied its electronic structure by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy which agrees closely with the first principles calculations. Moreover, anomalous Hall conductivity and Nernst effect are observed, resulting from the non-zero Berry curvature, and the topological Hall effect arising from changes in the band structure caused by spin canting produced by magnetic fields. These findings can help realize several exotic quantum phenomena in inorganic topological materials that are otherwise difficult to assess because of the presence of multiple pairs of Weyl nodes.},

	abstract = {We present an overview of our recent work on transport phenomena in Weyl metals, which may be connected to their nontrivial topological properties, particularly to chiral anomaly. We argue that there are two basic phenomena, which are related to chiral anomaly in Weyl metals: anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and chiral magnetic effect (CME). While AHE is in principle present in any ferromagnetic metal, we demonstrate that a magnetic Weyl metal is distinguished from an ordinary ferromagnetic metal by the absence of the extrinsic and the Fermi surface part of the intrinsic contributions to the AHE, as long as the Fermi energy is sufficiently close to the Weyl nodes. The AHE in a Weyl metal is thus shown to be a purely intrinsic, universal property, fully determined by the location of the Weyl nodes in the first Brillouin zone. In other words, a ferromagnetic Weyl metal may be thought of as the only example of a ferromagnetic metal with a purely intrinsic AHE. We further develop a fully microscopic theory of diffusive magnetotransport in Weyl metals. We derive coupled diffusion equations for the total and axial (i.e. node-antisymmetric) charge densities and show that chiral anomaly manifests as a magnetic-field-induced coupling between them. We demonstrate that an experimentally-observable consequence of CME in magnetotransport in Weyl metals is a quadratic negative magnetoresistance, which will dominate all other contributions to magnetoresistance under certain conditions and may be regarded as a smoking-gun transport characteristic, unique to Weyl metals.},

Classical nematics generally occur in liquids of rod-like molecules; given that electrons are point like, the initial theoretical motivation for contemplating electron nematics came from thinking of the electron fluid as a quantum melted electron crystal, rather than a strongly interacting descendent of a Fermi gas. Dramatic transport experiments in ultra-clean quantum Hall systems in 1999 and in Sr3Ru2O7 in a strong magnetic field in 2007 established that such phases exist in nature. In this article, we briefly review the theoretical considerations governing nematic order, summarize the quantum Hall and Sr3Ru2O7 experiments that unambiguously establish the existence of this phase, and survey some of the current evidence for such a phase in the cuprate and Fe-based high temperature superconductors.},

A common theme is the influence of spin-orbital entanglement produced by SOC, which influences the electronic and magnetic structure. In the weak-to-intermediate correlation regime, we show how nontrivial band-like topology leads to a plethora of phases related to topological insulators (TIs). We expound these ideas using the example of pyrochlore iridates, showing how many novel phases, such as the Weyl semimetal, axion insulator, topological Mott insulator, and TIs, may arise in this context. In the strong correlation regime, we argue that spin-orbital entanglement fully or partially removes orbital degeneracy, reducing or avoiding the normally ubiquitous Jahn-Teller effect. As we illustrate for the honeycomb-lattice iridates and double perovskites, this leads to enhanced quantum fluctuations of the spin-orbital entangled states and the chance to promote exotic spin liquid and multipolar ordered ground states. Connections to experiments, materials, and future directions are discussed.},

This phenomenon—initially thought to be rare—has now been observed in an increasing number of strongly interacting systems. In particular, the ubiquitous presence of nematicity in a number of unconventional superconductors suggests its importance in developing a unified understanding of their intricate phase diagrams and superconducting pairing. In this regard, the iron-based superconductors present an ideal material platform to study electronic nematicity. Their nematic transition is pronounced, it can be studied with a wide range of experimental techniques, it is easily tunable, and high-quality samples are widely available. Signatures of nematic quantum criticality near optimal dopings have been reported in almost all families of iron-based superconductors. Here we highlight how the nematic phase in this class of materials can be addressed in its full complexity, encompassing momentum-, time-, energy- and material-dependences. We also discuss a number of important open questions that pertain to how nematicity affects the superconducting pairing and normal-state properties, and intriguing quantum-critical behaviour near the nematic transition.},

In this Review, we critically assess LMR experiments in the Dirac–Weyl semimetals Na3Bi, GdPtBi, ZrTe5, Cd3As2 and TaAs, which have shown signatures of the chiral anomaly, and discuss possible current-jetting artefacts. The focus is on Dirac and Weyl nodes that are rigorously symmetry protected. Other experiments, such as non-local transport, thermopower, thermal conductivity and optical pump–probe response, are also reviewed. Looking ahead, we anticipate what can be gleaned from improved LMR experiments and new experiments on the thermal conductivity and optical response.

Here we report the coexisting two fluids in a prime ferromagnet, UGe2, in which an unconventional superconductivity occurs in a limited pressure range. Except for localized moments, itinerant quasiparticles give an additional magnetic moment, resulting in a first-order-like transition with increasing magnetic field at high pressures. Our findings suggest a collective spin-flip behavior of itinerant quasiparticles, instead of the previously reported metamagnetic transition.

We determine the key signatures of this phase, which are realized in the heavy-fermion semimetal Ce3Bi4Pd3.

So far, focus has been on weakly interacting systems, and little is known about the limit of strong electron correlations. Heavy fermion systems are a highly versatile platform to explore this regime. Here we report the discovery of a giant spontaneous Hall effect in the Kondo semimetal Ce3Bi4Pd3 that is noncentrosymmetric but preserves time reversal symmetry. We attribute this finding to Weyl nodes - singularities of the Berry curvature - that emerge in the immediate vicinity of the Fermi level due to the Kondo interaction. We stress that this phenomenon is distinct from the previously detected anomalous Hall effect in materials with broken time reversal symmetry; instead, it manifests an extreme topological response that requires a beyond-perturbation-theory description of the previously proposed nonlinear Hall effect. The large magnitude of the effect in even tiny electric and zero magnetic fields, as well as its robust bulk nature may aid the exploitation in topological quantum devices.},

	abstract = {The manifestation of Weyl fermions in strongly correlated electron systems is of particular interest. We report evidence for Weyl fermions in the heavy fermion semimetal YbPtBi from electronic structure calculations, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, magnetotransport and calorimetric measurements. At elevated temperatures where 4f-electrons are localized, there are triply degenerate points, yielding Weyl nodes in applied magnetic fields. These are revealed by a contribution from the chiral anomaly in the magnetotransport, which at low temperatures becomes negligible due to the influence of electronic correlations. Instead, Weyl fermions are inferred from the topological Hall effect, which provides evidence for a Berry curvature, and a cubic temperature dependence of the specific heat, as expected from the linear dispersion near the Weyl nodes. The results suggest that YbPtBi is a Weyl heavy fermion semimetal, where the Kondo interaction renormalizes the bands hosting Weyl points. These findings open up an opportunity to explore the interplay between topology and strong electronic correlations.},

	abstract = {The conditions necessary in metals for the presence or absence of localized moments on solute ions containing inner shell electrons are analyzed. A self-consistent Hartree-Fock treatment shows that there is a sharp transition between the magnetic state and the nonmagnetic state, depending on the density of states of free electrons, the s−d admixture matrix elements, and the Coulomb correlation integral in the d shell; that in the magnetic state the d polarization can be reduced rather severely to nonintegral values, without appreciable free electron polarization because of a compensation effect; and that in the nonmagnetic state the virtual localized d level tends to lie near the Fermi surface. It is emphasized that the condition for the magnetic state depends on the Coulomb (i.e., exchange self-energy) integral, and that the usual type of exchange alone is not large enough in d-shell ions to allow magnetic moments to be present. We show that the susceptibility and specific heat due to the inner shell electrons show strongly contrasting behavior even in the nonmagnetic state. A calculation including degenerate d orbitals and d−d exchange shows that the orbital angular momentum can be quenched, even when localized spin moments exist, and even on an isolated magnetic atom, by kinetic energy effects.},

Inclusion of d-electron interactions leads to three spin-dependent effects which, in the usual order of their sizes, we call: superexchange per se, which is always antiferromagnetic; direct exchange, always ferromagnetic; and an indirect polarization effect analogous to nuclear indirect exchange. Superexchange itself is shown to be closely related to the poor conductivity, in agreement with experiment. By means of crystal field theory the parameters determining superexchange can be estimated, and in favorable cases (NiO, LaFeO3) the exchange integrals can be evaluated with accuracy of several tens of percent. Qualitative understanding of the whole picture of exchange in iron group oxides and fluorides follows from these ideas.},

Topological Dirac or Weyl semimetals show linear dispersion around nodes, termed the Dirac or Weyl points, as the three-dimensional analog of graphene. We review the basic concepts and compare these topological states of matter from the materials perspective with a special focus on Weyl semimetals. The TaAs family is the ideal materials class to introduce the signatures of Weyl points in a pedagogical way, from Fermi arcs to the chiral magnetotransport properties, followed by hunting for the type-II Weyl semimetals in WTe2, MoTe2, and related compounds. Many materials are members of big families, and topological properties can be tuned. As one example, we introduce the multifunctional topological materials, Heusler compounds, in which both topological insulators and magnetic Weyl semimetals can be found. Instead of a comprehensive review, this article is expected to serve as a helpful introduction and summary by taking a snapshot of the quickly expanding field.},

In conventional treatments of the model the Kondo interaction is decoupled in favour of a hybridization of conduction and localized f electrons. However, such an approximation breaks the local gauge symmetry and implicates that the local f-occupation is no longer conserved. To avoid these problems, we use in this work an alternative approach to the model based on the Projective Renormalization Method (PRM). Thereby, within the conduction electron spectral function we identify the lattice Kondo resonance as an almost flat excitation near the Fermi surface which is composed of conduction electron creation operators combined with localized spin fluctuations. This leads to an alternative description of the Kondo resonance without having to resort to an artificial symmetry breaking.},

	abstract = {A detailed theoretical investigation on the structural, elastic, electronic, thermoelectric, thermodynamic and optical properties of half-Heusler MRhSb (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) compounds is presented. The computations are carried out using the full potential linear augmented plane wave method (FP-LAPW) within density functional theory (DFT). The optimized lattice parameters are in fairly good agreement with available experimental data. The computed elastic constants (Cij) and their related elastic moduli confirm the stability of the studied compounds in the cubic phase and highlight their ductile nature. Analysis of band structures and densities of states (DOS) profiles reveal the semiconducting nature with an indirect energy band gap (Γ-X). The bonding nature discussed via the electron charge density plot shows a mixture of covalent and ionic character. The evaluation of Seebeck coefficient leads to thermopower S ≥ 500 µeV which is very benefic for thermoelectric applications. Estimated thermodynamic characteristic within the quasi-harmonic approximation shows similar behavior for the three compounds. Finally, some optical spectra such as the complex dielectric function, refractive index, reflectivity, energy loss function and absorption are presented.},
