I would like to thank a number of people without whom I could not have completed this work. First and foremost, thank you to Andrea for his guidance and assistance in helping me become a better physicist, and thank you to William for helping to give me the opportunity to do this.\\

\noindent Thank you to the array of folks who helped me get the data I needed, including Prof. Cris Adriano and Raphael François at UNICAMP, Dr. Michael Nicklas at the Max Planck Institute, and Dr. Denis Sheptyakov at the Paul Scherrer Institut. \\

\noindent At l'Universit\'e de Montr\'eal, thank you to everyone in the research group for their company and support, to Liuke Liu for insightful discussions regarding the AMRO data, to Dr. Daniel Chartrand and Dr. Thierry Maris in the x-ray labs, and to lab technician Robert Rinfret. \\

\noindent Thank you to all my family and my friends for your patience while I secluded myself from the world to work on this. Most importantly, thank you to my father for your kindness, encouragement, and support, without which I could not have done any of this.
