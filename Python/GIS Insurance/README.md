Machine learning project using GIS wildfire information and US census data to predict the wildfire risk of US-based addresses.


Future additions:

- fuels & vegetation layers (LANDFIRE)
- weather/climate (GRIDMET, ERA5)
- topography (DEM-derived slope/aspect/elevation)
- WUI boundaries (USFS SILVIS)
