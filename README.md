# Data Science Portfolio
Personal data science portfolio showcasing Python and Power BI projects (and eventually SQL).

To verify completion of my DataCamp coursework, please visit my DataCamp portfolio page: https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/jdcf50


## Python
The Python project section showcases one example from my M.Sc. in physics, one project which uses machine learning on census data to predict wildfire risk for properties in the United States, and case studies done for DataCamp's data science courses.

N.B: Some of the Python projects require re-factoring, tidying, or removing proprietary information, and so appear somewhat empty for now.


### Recipe Site Traffic
Machine learning case study involving a hypothetical food recipe website seeking to increase traffic by identifying what kinds of recipes they ought to display on their front page.



### Predicting House Sale Prices
Machine learning case study predicting the sale price of houses for a hypothetical real estate company seeking to reduce the time to sale.



### Property Wildfire Risk (Currently Tidying)

Machine learning project to predict wildfire risk for US properties using US census data. Currently re-writing to remove proprietary information.



### AMRO Fourier Transform and Fit (Needs Refactoring)

An example of a Python data analysis I performed on angle-resolved magnetoresistance oscillation (AMRO) data. Currently needs significant tidying. 


### Demagnetization Analysis (Needs Tidying)

Involves extrapolating magnetization data using a modified Brillouin model.



## Power BI
The Power BI projects consist of case studies performed while studying DataCamp's 'Data Analyst in Power BI' course.


### Inventory Analysis
Case study of a hypothetical retailer seeking to improve their inventory management decisions.


### HR Analytics
Case study of a hypothetical software company seeking to minimize employee attrition rates.


### Customer Churn
Case study of a hypothetical telecom company looking to reduce customer churn.



## SQL (TBD)
Just some small snippets of SQL queries I wrote while taking DataCamp's 'Associate Data Analyst in SQL' course. I am currently tidying it up, as well.


### Manufacturing Process Analysis
Somewhat simple SQL query creating upper and lower control limits for an industrial process. Stored in a Python notebook.

### NGO Impact Analysis
Answering questions about a hypothetical NGO's impact on communities.


## M.Sc. Thesis Excerpt
A chapter from my thesis introducing background information relevant to the results.
